# Project

## What are we building?

A macOS menu bar app built with Electron that displays the current time in different timezones. Clicking the menu bar icon shows a dropdown with configurable timezones. Users should be able to add/remove timezones from a preferences window.

## Constraints

- Use Electron with electron-builder for packaging. Keep dependencies minimal. Store preferences in a local JSON file.

## Goals

- Menu bar icon shows current time. Clicking shows dropdown with all configured timezones. Preferences window to add/remove timezones. App starts on login option. README with setup and build instructions.
